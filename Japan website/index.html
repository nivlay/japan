      <h1>Travel In Japan</h1>
      <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
      <p>
        Mount Fuji (富士山) located on the island of Honshū, is the highest
        mountain in Japan, standing 3,776.24 m (12,389.2 ft). It is the
        second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci
        on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on
        Earth. Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano that last erupted from 1707
        to 1708. The mountain is located about 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Tokyo
        and is visible from there on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally
        symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the
        year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently
        depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers and
        climbers.

      <h2>Nara</h2>
      <p>
        Nara (奈良市) is the capital city of Nara Prefecture, Japan. As of 1

        largest city in Nara Prefecture and sixth-largest in the Kansai region
        of Honshu. Nara is a core city located in the northern part of Nara
        Prefecture bordering the Kyoto Prefecture. Nara was the capital of Japan
        during the Nara period from 710 to 794 as the seat of the Emperor before
        the capital was moved to Kyoto. Nara is home to eight temples, shrines,
        and ruins, specifically Tōdai-ji, Saidai-ji, Kōfuku-ji, Kasuga Shrine,
        Gangō-ji, Yakushi-ji, Tōshōdai-ji, and the Heijō Palace, together with
        Kasugayama Primeval Forest, collectively form the Historic Monuments of
        Ancient Nara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

      <h2>Shinjuku</h2>
      <p>
        Shinjuku (新宿区) is a special ward in Tokyo, Japan. It is a major
        commercial and administrative centre, housing the northern half of the
        busiest railway station in the world (Shinjuku Station) and the Tokyo
        Metropolitan Government Building, the administration centre for the
        government of Tokyo. As of 2018, the ward has an estimated population of
        346,235, and a population density of 18,232 people per km2. The total
        area is 18.23 km2.[3] Since the end of the Second World War, Shinjuku
        has been a major secondary center of Tokyo (fukutoshin), rivaling to the
        original city center in Marunouchi and Ginza. It literally means "New
        Inn Ward".
